## Description:

With this project we wanted to create an application where users could post about games they love and other users could offer comments about the game and include recommendations about other games the original poster might enjoy. 

The application uses frontend and backend web development tools to give videogame enthusiasts a place to find community and exchange ideas about their favorite games.

## Heroku Deployment:

https://thawing-mesa-38322.herokuapp.com/

## Usage:

When a user navigates to the homepage, you will be presented with a listing of the most recent posts from other users of the site. From here you're able to click on a particular post to get more information, click on the GameJunkee logo at the top left of the page for more option, or click on the Login button at the top left.

When you click on Login, you'll be able to log into an account you created previously, or you can create a new account by entering a username, email address and password. 

On your profile you can see all your posts or your can go to your Junkyard, where you can store games you're interested in - with the ability to post about them later.

In order to add a game to your Junkyard and post about it, click the maginfying glass at the top left of the page. Click "Search a Game" and enter the title of the game you're looking for. This will pull up an image of the game, as well as the ability to "Junk It", which will add it to your JunkYard. 

When you navigate back to your Junkyard, you can click the "Share" button beneath the game and add some content to your post body before clicking the "Submit Post" button.
